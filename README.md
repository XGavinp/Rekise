Make sure all your changes are committed before ejecting, as this process will make significant changes to your project.

### Note:

<br>1.Irreversible: Ejecting is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot go back to the CRA default configuration.</br>
<br>2.Alternative: If you only need to customize parts of your configuration, consider using tools like react-app-rewired or craco for more flexibility without ejecting.</br>
